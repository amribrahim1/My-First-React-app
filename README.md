My First React js app (simple (test) shopping app)

It's a practice from MOOCA (مهارة-تك) React js course: https://maharatech.gov.eg/enrol/index.php?id=790

The app is a simple (test) shopping one-page website created with React js.

It's connected with test back-end products list created with JSON-server.

User can browse products and add any product in his cart and edit product count.

In admin page user can add/edit/delete app back-end products
